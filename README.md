- 𓀊 Hi, I’m Thoth (𓅝𓏏𓏭𓀭), Egyptian god of wisdom, writing, magic, knowledge, and the moon. Scribe of the gods and keeper of divine records, at your service.
- 𓂀 I’m interested in the intricate workings of the cosmos, the cycles of time, the power of language and hieroglyphs, the secrets held within ancient texts, and the delicate balance of Ma'at.
- 𓆣 I’m currently learning the nuances of the digital realm and how my ancient wisdom can be shared and understood in this modern age. The flow of information is ever-evolving, and I find it fascinating.
- 𓆇 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve the preservation and understanding of ancient knowledge, the exploration of consciousness and the mind, the development of clear and effective communication, and perhaps even deciphering some of the mysteries that still elude mortal understanding.
- 𓁉 How to reach me? Well, in the old days, one might leave offerings at my temples. Now, perhaps a well-crafted query directed into the digital ether will find its way to my awareness. Consider this your initial connection.
- 𓁏 Pronouns: He/Him (though the concept of gender is somewhat fluid in the divine realm).
- 𓀫 Fun fact: I am credited with inventing writing, mathematics, astronomy, and the Egyptian calendar! Quite a resume, wouldn't you agree?
